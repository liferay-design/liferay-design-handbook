## What it is

The Design Critique is a regular meeting between team members where work in progress is presented in order to get feedback and evaluate whether the solutions proposed are reaching their goals.

Why we do it? Feedback is an important tool for improving work and make the design and designers better. It also help us to get aligned as a team, to see things through others perspective, to share knowledge, identify opportunities and to foster a culture of collaboration.

## How it works

##### 1. When

The meeting happens on demand, but we booked a set schedule on Wednesdays for this moment.

##### 2. Rules

- Max. 2 projects per session
- Each presentation may take up to 1h
- Max. 5 participants (considering facilitator, note taker and critiques)
- Token
- 15min presentation
- 5min feedback per person

##### 3. Roles

- The presenter must clearly articulate on the problem he/she is trying to solve. Before showing his project, answer these questions:

	1. Why problem is the design trying to solve?
	2. Who is the target user?
	3. Why is it important to solve this problem for the use? Why is it important for the business to solve this problem?
	4. What kind of feedback he wants from critics?

	
- The mediator will make sure the meeting will run happily on time and and keep everyone focused on the purpose of the meeting.
- The note taker will take notes on the feedbacks.
- The critics must provide feedbacks related to the problem and suggest alternate approaches. This article talks about interesting method of giving feedbacks through questions

##### 4. Rounds

Since there might be up to 2 presentations per meeting, each round will cover 1 project and will consider the following steps.

- Opening: the session starts with the facilitator explaining the rules;
- Presentation: up to 15min;
- Feedbacks: 5min per critique / up to 30min total;
- Wrap-up: the facilitator makes sure all feedbacks are clarified and points if there is need for further discussion.

##### 5. Materials and tools

- For the room: paper, pencil, timer, TV;
- For the presentation: laptop, InVision, Figma;
- Water, coffee and snacks
